A CLI tool to run multiple npm-scripts in parallel or sequential.

## npm-run-all2 why?

**A maintenance fork of npm-run-all.**  npm-run-all2 is a fork of npm-run-all with dependabot updates, release automation enabled and some troublesome babel stuff removed to further reduce maintenance burden.  Hopefully this labor can upstream some day when mysticatea returns, but until then, welcome aboard!

## ‚§¥Ô∏è Motivation

- **Simplify.** The official `npm run-script` command cannot run multiple scripts, so if we want to run multiple scripts, it's redundant a bit. Let's shorten it by glob-like patterns.<br>
  Before: `npm run clean && npm run build:css && npm run build:js && npm run build:html`<br>
  After: `npm-run-all clean build:*`
- **Cross platform.** We sometimes use `&` to run multiple command in parallel, but `cmd.exe` (`npm run-script` uses it by default) does not support the `&`. Half of Node.js users are using it on Windows, so the use of `&` might block contributions. `npm-run-all --parallel` works well on Windows as well.

## üíø Installation

```bash
$ npm install npm-run-all2 --save-dev
# or
$ yarn add npm-run-all2 --dev
```

- It requires `Node@>=14`. It may work on older versions of Node, but no guarantees are given.

## üìñ Usage

### CLI Commands

This `npm-run-all` package provides 3 CLI commands.

- [npm-run-all]
- [run-s]
- [run-p]

The main command is [npm-run-all].
We can make complex plans with [npm-run-all] command.

Both [run-s] and [run-p] are shorthand commands.
[run-s] is for sequential, [run-p] is for parallel.
We can make simple plans with those commands.

#### Yarn / pnpm Compatibility

`npm-run-all` is compatible with both Yarn and pnpm. If a script is invoked using either package manager, `npm-run-all` will correctly utilize it to execute the plan's child scripts.

### Node API

This `npm-run-all` package provides Node API.
